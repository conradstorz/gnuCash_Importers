""" This is as close as i have gotten to a bill import file for gnucash. 

"When importing bills into GnuCash using a CSV file, the expected fields and their sequence are as follows:

Field Name	Required	Description
id	Yes	Invoice (Bill) ID. If blank in the first row, that invoice will not be imported.
date_opened	No	Opening date for the bill (matches Preferences date format), defaults to today if blank/invalid.
owner_id	Yes	Vendor number. Must be present in the first data row for each bill and must exist in vendor master.
billingid	No	Billing ID. Optional.
notes	No	Bill notes. Optional.
date	No	Entry date. Defaults to date_opened if blank/invalid.
desc	No	Description for the entry. Optional.
action	No	Action. Optional.
account	Yes	Account for the entry. Must exist. Mandatory for every row.
quantity	No	Quantity, defaults to 1 if blank.
price	Yes	Price for the entry. Required.
disc_type	No	Discount type. Optional. Not relevant for bills.
disc_how	No	Discount how. Optional. Not relevant for bills.
discount	No	Discount amount or percent. Optional. Not relevant for bills.
taxable	No	Is this entry taxable? Use “Y” or “X” for yes, “N” or blank for no.
taxincluded	No	Is tax included in price? Use “Y” or “X” for yes, “N” or blank for no.
tax_table	No	Tax table. Optional. Blank if not found.
date_posted	No	Date bill was posted (if applicable), matches Preferences date format.
due_date	No	Due date. Defaults to date posted if blank. Only relevant in first row if posting bill.
account_posted	No	Post to account for vendor. Mandatory in first row if posting bill; must be Accounts Payable type account.
memo_posted	No	Posting memo. Optional. Only relevant in first row of a posted bill.
accu_splits	No	Accumulate splits? “Y” or “X” for yes, “N” or blank for no. Only in first row of a posted bill.
Notes:

Rows correspond to individual bill entries; all fields must be present in each row (placeholder empty fields accepted).

Fields not applicable to bills (like discounts and some tax fields) can be left blank.

Columns must appear in this exact order and with this number of fields, even if many are left empty.

The owner_id must correspond to an existing vendor in your GnuCash data, and the account must exist.
